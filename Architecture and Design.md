# Multi-Tenant Order Management System - High-Level System Design

## 1. Architecture Overview

### Application Layers

- **Presentation Layer (API)**  
  Exposes RESTful endpoints to tenants for order management (e.g., orders, users, reports).
  
- **Application Layer**  
  Handles business logic and use cases.

- **Domain Layer**  
  Contains domain entities, and domain services.

- **Infrastructure Layer**  
  Implements persistence (database interactions using Entity Framework Core), external APIs, authentication, logging, and email notifications.

### Multitenancy Approach

- **Shared Schema, Tenant Discriminator Column**  
  A single database with shared tables. Each record is associated with a `TenantId`. EF Core filters are used to enforce tenant scoping.

  Pros:
  - Cost-effective
  - Easier to maintain
  - Scales well for a medium number of tenants

  Cons:
  - Higher complexity for isolation and data access control

> Alternatively, the design allows switching to **Schema-per-Tenant** for premium customers if needed.

### API Structure

- **Versioned REST API**  
/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/orders
/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/users
- Authenticated access via OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (Azure AD B2C or IdentityServer)
- Middleware for extracting and validating `TenantId` from JWT and HTTP headers

### Hosting Strategy

- **Azure App Services** (default for lower operational overhead)
- **Dockerized** .NET apps for containerization, enabling:
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for advanced scaling needs
- Easier CI/CD pipelines and local development parity

## 2. Technology Stack

### Backend
- **.NET 8 Web API**
- **Entity Framework Core**
- **FluentValidation / MediatR** for CQRS and validation
- **AutoMapper** for DTO mapping

### Database
- **Azure SQL Database** (shared instance with elastic pools)
- **Redis Cache** for caching common lookups
- **Blob Storage** for document attachments

### CI/CD Tools
- **Azure DevOps Pipelines** for build, test, and release
- **Bicep / ARM Templates** for infrastructure as code

### Logging, Monitoring, Testing Tools
- **Serilog + Azure Application Insights** for centralized logging
- **Health Checks** via `.NET HealthChecks` and Azure Monitor
- **xUnit + Moq** for unit testing
- **Playwright or Postman** for integration and API tests

---

## 3. Key Considerations

### Enforcing Tenant Isolation

- Middleware-based `TenantContext` extracted from JWT and request headers
- Global query filters in EF Core using `HasQueryFilter(x => x.TenantId == tenantId)`
- Row-level security (RLS) in Azure SQL (if needed)
- Scoped services per tenant in DI container

### Scalability & Performance

- **Horizontal scaling** of App Services or AKS pods
- **Elastic pools** for Azure SQL to auto-scale based on tenant activity
- **Caching** with Redis to reduce DB load
- **Asynchronous background jobs** using Azure Functions or Hangfire

### DevOps & Deployment Strategy

- **Branching strategy:** Git Flow
- **Environments:** Dev → QA → Staging → Production
- **Feature flags** for incremental feature rollout
- **Blue/Green or Canary deployments** for minimal downtime

### Team Structure and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Tech Lead | System architecture, code reviews, DevOps guidance |
| Backend Developers | Build API, domain logic, unit tests |
| DevOps Engineer | Setup CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring |
| QA Engineer | Create and run test cases (manual and automated) |
| Product Owner | Define features, roadmap, priority |
| Scrum Master | Facilitate agile ceremonies and delivery |
