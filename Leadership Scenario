As a technical lead, if I notice a team member regularly delaying tasks and not adhering to our coding standards, I would address it directly but respectfully. I begin with a private, personal conversation with them. The goal is not to blame them, but to understand them. I ask if they face any obstacles, whether technical or personal, that affect their performance. Sometimes, people suffer in silence, and a simple conversation can help reveal what is going on.

Once I understand their situation, I explain the impact of their delays and code inconsistencies on the team and the project. I also emphasize the need to address recurring problems, especially in critical tasks. Additionally, I provide specific examples, offer support, and agree on concrete steps for improvement, such as breaking tasks into smaller parts, reviewing code together, or collaborating with another team member when needed.

To ensure the delivery process is on track despite this situation, I review the project plan with the team and temporarily redistribute some tasks as necessary. Although this may be difficult, it is necessary to meet the delivery schedule. Additionally, I focus on code reviews and holding regular meetings to catch issues early and keep everyone aligned. I ensure that communication remains open and fair, and no one feels overburdened or as if they are constantly covering for someone else. Furthermore, if the team sees that I am effectively addressing the problem rather than ignoring it, they are more likely to stay motivated and feel respected.

Finally, to prevent this from happening again, I work to strengthen our expectations regarding task accountability and code quality. We might conduct a quick review of our coding guidelines or create automated checks to catch problems early. I also start holding short, regular meetings with every team member, not just the one having a problem, so I can identify and address issues early.
