As a technical lead, if I notice that a team member is regularly delaying tasks and not adhering to our coding standards, I will address it directly but respectfully. I will have a private, personal conversation with them first. The goal is not to blame them, but to understand them. I will ask them if they face any obstacles, whether technical or personal, that affect their performance. Sometimes people suffer in silence, and a simple conversation can help reveal what is going on.
