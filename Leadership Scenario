As a technical lead, if I notice that a team member is regularly delaying tasks and not adhering to our coding standards, I will address it directly but respectfully. I will begin with a private, personal conversation with them first. The goal is not to blame them, but to understand them. I will ask them if they face any obstacles, whether technical or personal, that affect their performance. Sometimes, people suffer in silence, and a simple conversation can help reveal what is going on.

Once I understand their situation, I will explain to them the impact of their delays and code inconsistencies on the team and the project. I will also emphasize the need to address recurring problems, especially in critical tasks. Additionally, I will provide specific examples, offer support, and agree on concrete steps for improvement, such as breaking down tasks further, reviewing code together, or collaborating with another team member when needed.
