As a technical lead, if I notice that a team member is regularly delaying tasks and not adhering to our coding standards, I will address it directly but respectfully. I will begin with a private, personal conversation with them first. The goal is not to blame them, but to understand them. I will ask them if they face any obstacles, whether technical or personal, that affect their performance. Sometimes, people suffer in silence, and a simple conversation can help reveal what is going on.

Once I understand their situation, I will explain to them the impact of their delays and code inconsistencies on the team and the project. I will also emphasize the need to address recurring problems, especially in critical tasks. Additionally, I will provide specific examples, offer support, and agree on concrete steps for improvement, such as breaking down tasks further, reviewing code together, or collaborating with another team member when needed.

To ensure the delivery process is on track, I will review the project plan with the team and temporarily redistribute some tasks as necessary. Although this solution may be difficult, it is necessary because adhering to the delivery schedule is critical. Additionally, I will focus on code reviews and holding regular meetings to catch issues early and keep everyone in touch.
